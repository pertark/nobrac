This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

# Nobrac: Enabling Accessible and Streamlined Carbon Credit Transactions

## Mission

Nobrac aims to increase the demand for on-chain carbon credits by creating an accessible and rewarding application. Our mission is to mitigate the effects of climate change by providing a platform that facilitates the process of buying carbon credits and being carbon neutral.

## Problem

The increase in carbon dioxide is intensifying the natural greenhouse effect, resulting in a rise in global temperatures. This leads to regional and seasonal temperature extremes, diminished snow cover and sea ice, amplified heavy rainfall, and devastating habitats for flora and fauna. Climate change is a pressing issue, and urgent action is needed to mitigate its worst outcomes.

## Inspiration

The process for obtaining carbon credits is often long and tedious. The urgent need to limit temperature rise and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 inspired the creation of Nobrac. We strive to simplify and streamline the carbon credit acquisition process, making it more accessible to a broader audience.

## What Nobrac Does

Nobrac is an application that allows users to buy carbon credits and achieve carbon neutrality. It provides a universal platform for both businesses and individuals to establish themselves as carbon neutral entities.
