# Nobrac: Enabling Accessible and Streamlined Carbon Credit Transactions

## Mission ðŸ§ 

Nobrac aims to increase the demand for on-chain carbon credits by creating an accessible and rewarding application. Our mission is to mitigate the effects of climate change by providing a platform that facilitates the process of buying carbon credits and being carbon neutral.

## Problem ðŸ”Ž

An increase in carbon dioxide is supercharging the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise. 

This is important because that extra heat is... <br />
    - driving regional and seasonal temperature extremes <br />
    - diminishing snow cover and sea ice <br />
    - amplifying heavy rainfall <br />
    - devastating habitats for both flora and fauna <br />
    
Climate change is a pressing issue, and urgent action is needed to mitigate its worst outcomes.

## Inspiration ðŸŒŸ 

The process for obtaining carbon credits is often long and tedious. The urgent need to limit temperature rise and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 inspired the creation of Nobrac. We strive to simplify and streamline the carbon credit acquisition process, making it more accessible to a broader audience.

## What Nobrac Does ðŸŒ±

Nobrac is an application that allows users to buy carbon credits and achieve carbon neutrality. It provides a universal platform for both businesses and individuals to establish themselves as carbon neutral entities.
